# Basics of Javascript #
Javascript is a language that adds interactivity to a website. 
------------------------------------
## Here a some basics ##
Javascript has reserved keyword
Variables should have meaninful names
Variables cannot contain a space or hyper (-)
Variables are case-sensitive 
We use a constant when we don't want something to change. 

## Types ##

| Primitives/Value Types | Reference Types |
|----------|---|
| String   |  |
| Number   |   |
| Boolean  |   |
|undefined |  |
|null      |  |


Dynamic means it can change at run time. 

## Console:
You can write type in console. 


## Objects 
Declaring a person object, instead of referencing two different variable. 
Object literal looks like this
let person = {
    name: "Eliza" 
};

### Using dot notation. 
person.name = "John";

Backet Notation helps us access in a dynamic way.
Can access property using Bracket Notation person['name'] = 'Mary';

## Array
You may deal with a list of objects. An example may be a use of colours the user has selected. Array is an object. 

## Array literal
[]

## Functions

functions can have inputs and that can change how it behaviour. 
function great(name) { //passing in parameter 
    This is the body 
}

great('John'); //argument is the actual value you supply.
