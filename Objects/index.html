      <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
      <p>Basics</p>
      <p>Objects are collections of key values pairs. If you have properties that are highly related, we want to encapsulate them inside of an object.
        We could declare lots of related variables, however a better approach is to put that in an object. Now we can send that object anywhere in our program, we can pass it to any functions.

        The purpose is to group related varibles. However, it's not just grouping related variables, quite often we have functions that shuld operate on variables. Instead of defining functions in a 
        stand alone way, it's better to put these functions, inside of the object.

        What you see in exercise one is object orientated programming.
      </p>

      <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
      <p>Creating two circle objects</p>
      <p><br>We don't want to duplicate implementation because if we have a bug in that method we will have to fix it in multiple places.
        If our objects have logic we need a different way to create objects.
        That's when we use a factory method or constructor functions. 
        Factory functions produce objects. </br>

        <br>Therefore we a making a function caled createCircle, then we move the diffenition inside the factory faction. 
        We will be return an object. We are passing radius as a paramenter instead of coding one.</br>
        

      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 3</h2>
      <p>Create Circle</p>
      <p>We are doing Constructor function. The constructor pattern function
        <br>When naming constructor functions we should use Pastal notation (OneTwoThreeFour).
        In Javascript we have a keyword called this, and this is a reference to the object accessing this piece of code.  
        We are using dot notation which helps us access properties of an object, read a property, or we can set a property.
        In Javascript our objects are dynamic. </br>

        <br>Radius is the distance from the center to the circumference of a cirlce. It is half of the circles fiameter.
        r = circumderence/2Pi.</br>

        <br>We will be using new which creates a new Javascript object.</br>

        <br>Factory vs constructor functions:</br>
        
        Factory Function example:
        Creates objects and returns it.
        function personFactory() {
          return {}
        }
        A contructor function:
        function Person(a) {
          this.name = n;
        }
        const me = new Person('Eliza')

        <br>The constructor pattenr is familar to developers who have experience with programming in languages like C# and Java. </br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 4</h2>
      <p>Circle</p>
      <p>
        <br>We also delete existing properties or methods.
        We can use delete operator to delete member from circle object.</br>
        
        <br>We are using a constant. Therefore, we cannot reset circle to a new object.
        However, we can change the circle object by adding or removing properties.</br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 5</h2>
      <p>Continuing createCircle</p>
      <p>To look at the constuctor in this exercise, you can go another.constructor in the console.
        In javascript we have a few other build in constructors, for example, we have String() for creating string. However, quite often we use string literals.
        This would be '', "", etc. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 6</h2>
      <p>Circle: Functions as objects</p>
      <p>One of the confusing concepts in Javascript is here functions are objects.
        <br>In VS if you write Circle. it will show you all the members of the cirlce function.
        If you look at the list the pops up you'll see the purple icons which are methods (call, bind, and apply) and the blue icons are properties.
        </br>
        <br>If you want to explore this further in the dev console you can write `Circle.name` or `Circle.length`</br>
        <br>It's good to know that every object in Javascript has a constructor property, and that references the function that 
        was used to create that object. </br>
        <br>When we declare a function using the this sytax `function Circle(radius) {
          internally, the Javascript engine will use the function constructor to create the object.
        </br>
        <br>In the function we use a backtick character. </br>
        <br>Circle.call({}, 1) is the same as const another = new Circle(1);</br>
        <br>When we use the new operator, this new operator will interally create an empty argument to the call method. And this object will determine the context of the function code, so, 
        it will reference the object {}.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 7</h2>
      <p>Categories of types</p>
      <p><br>In this part we are learning how primitives and objects dehave differently.
        When we use an object, that object is not stored in this variable. That object is stored somewhere else in the memory and the 
        memory location is story inside that memory variable.</br>
        <br>Therefore, when we copy x into y, it's the address or reference which is copied. In other words, both x and y are pointing to the same address in memory. 
        When we modify that object using x or y, the changes are immediately visible to the other varible.</br>
        <br>Primitives are copied by their value. Objects are copied by their reference.</br>
      </p>

      <h2>Exercise 8</h2>
      <p>Using loops and objects</p>
      <p><br>For in we cna iterate over all the properties and methods of an object.
      In the loop we are using the bracket notation to get the value of the key or its property.</br>
      <br>We also have the for of loop. This can only be used with iterables such aas arrays and maps. 
      An objects is not iterable. However, we have a method called Object.key(circle), this will allow us to get all the 
      keys in our circle object, this will return an array. This is a built in constructor function.</br>
      <br>When we create an object using the object literal syntax, interally that is translated to a call an object constructor function. </br>
      <br>Object.entries returns each value pair as an array.</br>
      <br>sometimes what you'll want to see is if a given object has a given property or method. 
      To do that, you can use the in operator. Example: if ('radius' in circle)</br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 9</h2>
      <p>Enumeating the properties of an object</p>
      <p><br>Using this technique we can get all the properties in an object
        and copy them into another object. </br>
        <br>For this we use the for in loop to iterate over all the properties in a object. 
        Then we use the bracket notation. </br>
        <br>Garbage collection. As a Javascript developer you do not have to worry about this.
        Memory allocation and deallocation automatically happens behind the scenes, you have no control over that.
        The garage collector runs in the background.</br>

      <h2>Exercise 10</h2>
      <p>Math</p>
      <br>This section looks at build in objects</br>
      <br>We have a math object built into Javascript</br>
      <br>If we look at Math.random(), everytime we call the method we get a new random number between
      0 to 1. </br>
      <br>If you want to map this to a given range you need a mathematical formular.</br>
      <br>We also have Math.round, Math.max and Math.min</br>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 11</h2>
      <p>String</p>
      <br>Another build in object we are going to look at is string.</br>
      <br>In Javascript we have string primitives and string objects.</br>
      <br>In the console you can write message.lenght, message[0], message.endsWith('e'), message.indexOf('my'),
      message.toUpperCase(), message.replace('first', 'second'), message.trim(), message.split</br>
      <br>Escape Notation this is used to escape a String in Javascript</br>

      <br>So far we have learnt about different kinds of literals in Javascript </br>

      <br>Objects are reference types, so we can have the same properties, but htese objects are in different memory locations.
      When we use this we are checking ot see if these objects have the same reference. Return true if they are the same.</br>
      <br>The other function is areSame, which tells us if they are pointing to the exact same object</br>
