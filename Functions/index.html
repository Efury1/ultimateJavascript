      <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
      <p>
        <br>We are creating a function called walk. This is what we call a function declaration.</br>
        <br>There's also another way to write a function, this is called a function expression.</br>
        <br>Function declaration vs function expression.</br>
        <br>Named Function expressions and a named Anonymous Function Expression</br>

      <p>Arguments</p>
      <p>
        <br>We have learnt that Javascript is a dynamic language</br>
        <br>Here we have definded a function that has two paratermers. </br>
        <br>1 + undefinded = NaN</br>
        <br>Every function in Javascript has a special object called arguments</br>
        <br>If you want to have a funciton with a varing number of parameters to work with all the arguments that are passed ot that function</br>

        <br>Spread and rest operator can look the same. </br>
        <br>However when we use ... this with the parameter of the function </br>
        <br>When we apply the rest operator with a parameter of function, we pass a varying number of objects.</br>
        <br>We cannot have a parameter after the rest operator</br>

        <br>In this exercise we are calculating interest.</br>
        <br>Default values for the number of years. </br>

        <br>
        We should do error handing at the begineering of a program or method. This is called defensive programmign.

        <br>People confuse errors and exceptions but there's a differece.</br>

        <br>You can declare car variables, however you should avoid it.</br>
        <br>Let and const, to define different variables and constants.
        You can use Window.console property returns a reference to the console object, 
        which provides methods for logging inforamtion to the browser's console.
