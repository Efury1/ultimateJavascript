  <h2>Arrays</h2>
  <p>Within this we look at adding new elements, finding elements, removing elements, splitting arrays and combining arrays.</p>
</div>

      <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
      <p>Adding elements to array</p>
      <p>We have declared numbers as a constant. This means we cannot reassign number to something else, however we can modify contents of the array. </p>
      <p>Arrays are objects therefore we can use dot notation. We are are going to add to the end, beginning and end of array.</p>
      <p>The end being push</p>
      <p>The beginning being unshift</p>
      <p>The middle being splice</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
      <p>Finding Elements</p>
      <p>Finding elements in array really depending on if you're storing primitives or reference types in an array</p>
      <p>In this exercise we start with primitives because they are easier and then we will find reference types in an array.</p>
      <p>We are using indexOf. For this we pass the element we are looking for, and if that element exists in the array, this method will return the index of that element.</p>
      <p>It will return minus 1, if it doesn't exist</p>
      <p>To get the last index of the array we use lastIndexOf() method returns the index(position) of the last occurrence of a specified value. </p>
      <p>All the methods included in this exercise have a second perimeter which is optional and this is the starting index. 
        For example, with index of let's change this to one as a number, meaning the index of 1 is 0. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 3</h2>
      <p>Finding Elements(Reference types) </p>
      <p>In this exercise we started with declaring a new array called courses.
      In this array we are going to have a couple of course objects. </p>
      <p>We have two course objects, if we have name</p>
      <p>If you have an array with reference types, you need to learn the find method.</p>
      <p>As an a argument ot this method, we have to call a function. We call this function a predicate, and we use that to
        determine if the given element exists in an array not. So, the function takes parameter that's an element in this array.
        And in the body of this function, we should return a boolean. 
      </p>
      <p>In ES6 there is a shorter and cleaner way to write the same code using arrow functions, as a callback function or as an argument for a different method,
        you can use the arrow function syntax.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 4</h2>
      <p>Removing Elements</p>
      <p>When it comes to removing elements in array we can remove it from the beginning, middle or end.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 5</h2>
      <p>Some text..</p>
      <p>Sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 6</h2>
      <p>Some text..</p>
      <p>Sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 7</h2>
      <p>Emptying an array</p>
      <p>We can resign to a new array. If we have no other references it will go into garage collection.
        Another solution would be setting the lengths property to 0. Therefore orginal array would truncated.
        The third solution would be to use the slice method. Therefore, we could start at the first and go to last which would be numbers.length.
        The last way to do this would to be using the pop method, you can put this in a loop and call this until there's no length.
        The last solution is not the best because if you're dealing with a large array there will be a performance cost.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 8</h2>
      <p>Combining and splicing and array into two part</p>
      <p>We use the concat them to contact to array.</p>
      <p>We then practise using slice. We use slice by starting and two and finishing at four. Therefore, we receive 2,4. We also try starting the array at 2. </p>
      <p>One thing to understand about both these methods is when you're dealing with primitive values, they will be copied into a primitive array. </p>
      <p>However, if you objects in array, the objects themselves are not copied, the references are copied.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Exercise 9</h2>
      <p>The spread operator</p>
      <p>Here we use the spread operator which is in ES6.</p>
      <p>In this exercise we rewrite our code from exercise 8 and make sure we have a cleaner approach.</p>
