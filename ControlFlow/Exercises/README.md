FizzBuzz a common interview program, asked in software developer job interviews. 

A way to improve on the activity is to look at the Auxiliary Space: 0(1).
The modulo operator is a costly way to solve a problem in terms of complexity. 

You can also think about the Time Complexity.

The scope:
If number is divisible by 3 we get fiz.
If number is divisible by 5 we get buzz.
If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, we get fizzBuz.
Not divisible by 3 or 5, we get input.
Not a number we get'Not number'.

Given two numbers, are task is to check whether the number is divisible by the second or not. 
To evaluatie if something is  divisible:
variable % 2 === 0
