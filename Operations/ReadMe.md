### Operations

We have different types of operations We have arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical and Bitwise operators. 

## Decrement 
x--

## Increment
x++

## Remainder of division
x % y

## Exponentiation
x ** y


## Comparison Operators
Checking if a number is greater than another. 
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
!== not equal tro 
==== equal to 

## Equality Operators
=== strict equality operator (Type + Value are the same)
== lose equality operator (If you have a strong of 1 and a value of 1 then it converts it)
    (true == 1 ) will return tre
    ('1' === 1 ) will be true 

## Logical Operators
We have three types of logical operators

## Logical AND (&&)
Return true if both operands are true

## Logical OR
Return true if one of the operands is true

## Not !
let applicationRefused = !eligibleForLoan

## Bitwise Operators

A bit is eight bits. You can convert between decimal and bbitwise. 

1 = 00000001
2 = 00000010
3 = 00000011

1 | 2 =
R = 00000000

This can be use bitwise if we want to implement an access control system, 
where users can read, write and execute. We use eight bits to determine what to they can use.

## Read, Write, Execute
0000100
This number because the user can only use read. 

## Bitwise or we can add permissions
with bitwise or we can check if we have a given permission 

## Precendence of operatores
let x = 2 + 3 * 4;
